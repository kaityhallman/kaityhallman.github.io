        I’m a <span className='callout'>front end software engineer</span> based in <span className='callout'>Boston, MA</span>. I studied studio art in college at a small, all women’s liberal arts school (print design, film photography, and printmaking), but I’ve always been interested in tech since a small age - started using computers at age 3. After graduation and a year of doing print design professionally, I craved work that would challenge me to use my creative brain in a different way than I ever had before. I attended <a href='http://www.techtalentsouth.com' className='link' target='_blank'>Tech Talent South</a>’s
        code immersion program, fell in love with coding, and never looked back. For me, front end development is the perfect fusion of creative and logical, conceiving within me a sense of passionate problem solving, dedication to my craft and product, and an unyielding curiosity.
